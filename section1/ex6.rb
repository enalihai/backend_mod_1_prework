# Setting a variable with an integer.
types_of_people = 10
# Setting a variable with a string containing a different variable.
x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
# Setting binary as a variable.
binary = "binary"
# Setting do_not as a variable that is a string.
do_not = "don't"
# setting another variable with two different variables inside.
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."
# Prints variable x.
puts x
# Prints variable y.
puts y
# Prints a string with a variable inside.
puts "I said: #{x}."
# Prints a string with a variable inside.
puts "I also said: '#{y}'."
# Setting variable hilarious to a boolean value.
hilarious = false
# Setting variable with string containing boolean variable.
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"
# Prints the joke_evaluation variable.
puts joke_evaluation
# Setting w as a variable containing a string.
w = "This is the left side of..."
# Setting e as a variable containg a string.
e = "a string with a right side."
# Prints the addition of two variables. not a math function , just combining.
puts w + e

# ===== Study Drills =====
# 1. Added comments to each line of code.
# 2. Found all strings inside strings.
# 3. I actually think there are only 3...
# 4. Because it isn't a math function, it is just combining the two variables.
# 5. They do not work because it is confusing the code telling it a new string
# is starting or a string is ending when you are want it in the code.
