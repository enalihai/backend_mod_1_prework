## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  I enjoy reading about little ways that we can improve what we do. I already read a lot of novels and news articles, so changing that to include articles about tech and code is step 1. I want to adopt a growth mindset more most of all. Not pressure myself to see immediate understanding. I would emphasize the take care of your brain more! Sleep, exercise and nutrition will make this career much more easy if you have a process.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?\
    puts "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?\
    The # is the character used. Named the octothorpe.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?\
    An integer is a number with no decimal. A float is an integer with a decimal component

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`\
    animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?\
puts animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    Interpolation is drawing on data already stored in your code to replace other placeholders withing the #{} bracket.

    puts "Look at that #{animal}"

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
    The gets method is what is used. it takes input from the user as a string and then stores it for a variable.  

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
    .count - will count the number of characters in a string. can specify with ("")
    .upcase - will capitalize all characters inside the string variable
