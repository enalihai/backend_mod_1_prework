# ===== Study Drills =====
# 1. Changed all variables to remove 'my_' from beginning.
# 2. Uncomment (cmd + /) the below lines 24-28 to see my code calculation.
# inch = 2.54 # centimeter per inch
# pound = 0.453592 # kilogram per pound
#
# puts "There are #{3 * inch} centimeters in 3 inches."
# puts "There are #{4 * pound} kilograms in 4 pounds."
