## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  I am 100% in on asking questions. I like to ask questions when I have a good indication that the answerer will be able to explain it to me. While I have been working essentially alone over the past years, I have used YouTube as a big resource to answer questions. I do not fear asking questions if I am in a class or group at work. I want to make sure I understand so that there is no confusion at a later date.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.


    A conditional statement is used to control conditional instructions.
    if/elsif/else
    unless
    case

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?


    I would use an if-statement when there are multiple choices to produce different ending results

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?


    if
      puts
    end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?


    Using the "elsif" and "else"

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:


if X > 2
  puts "x is greater than 2"
elsif x <= 2 and x!=0
  puts "x is 1"
else
  puts "I can't guess the number."
end


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  We could use the conditional statement to operate based on a boolean variable. You could also use a when keyword to help determine when the code will run.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  A method is used to return a value from a set of different expressions. It allows you to invoke other parts of your code in different sections.
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    def hello
      puts '"Sam I am"'
    end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.


    def hello_someone(name)
      puts '"#{name} I am"'
    end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  hello_someone(name)

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?


  Honestly, I have quite a few questions. However, I know most of my questions stem from ignorance and not misunderstanding. I will be coming back to this lesson multiple times. When I am done with my prework, I will be going back through the work to see what concepts I still need help on. How to define the argument in the method is a first one for me. I would like to know more about loops!
